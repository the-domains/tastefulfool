  My mother wrote copiously in longhand journals after she no longer had a
  husband. I have no idea whether she wanted others to read the thousands of
  pages after she died. Some, mice have eaten. Some spilled out of boxes in the
  chaos of many hands sorting through the things left.

My mother wrote copiously in longhand journals after she no longer had a husband. I have no idea whether she wanted others to read the thousands of pages after she died. Some, mice have eaten. Some spilled out of boxes in the chaos of many hands sorting through the things left.

I have most often written for others. Since this trip. Since being in places I choose. Since all ties have loosened, I write less and less. I try to work out in my mind what it means to nevertheless put words down. To leave them. I want to write about things I have no idea whether I want others to see, ever. Yet I want to see what I have written.

I have been very sad since landing here in Millbrook, New York. There is a little house sitting nearby that these new friends want to put me in. The pull of my old self is strong. The pull of their generosity is strong. The old self that would love that house, relish the support of such extraordinary people. So many things about it so perfect.

But what I want is to look out this window of this rolling house that is my own, to look at the colors and shapes through this frame of good size. Sit in the quiet with my dogs and cat. That's all I want to do.

Everything I have done, everything that has happened has all led to this cutting through to what it is for me to live this life, this life that is no one else's but mine.
