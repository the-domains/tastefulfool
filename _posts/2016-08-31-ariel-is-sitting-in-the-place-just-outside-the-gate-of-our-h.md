  Ariel is sitting in the place just outside the gate of our home in Ben Lomond,
  California, where I last hugged Luc and told him I love him. He was wearing a
  soft, cable sweater and I had become so short that my face pressed against his
  heart. I lived there for another six months after Luc died. Every time I went
  through the gate my heart tore and I could barely make it to the front door.
  We left that beautiful home, the friends, in August 2013.
